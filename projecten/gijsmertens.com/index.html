        <div id="index-div">
            I'm Gijs Mertens, a 17-year-old karting sensation, and I'm thrilled to share my journey in motorsport.
            My passion for karting ignited at the age of eight when I first witnessed the excitement of go-karts on the track.
            I persuaded my parents to get me my first kart, setting the stage for an incredible journey.
            </br></br>
            Karting has been my school of precision, control, and strategy.
            I've dedicated years to honing these skills, learning from every race and coach.
            Notable achievements include winning the XYZ Karting Championship in 2020 and setting a track record at the City Speed Circuit in 2021.
            </br></br>
            But my ambition extends beyond karting.
            My dream is to reach Formula 1, recognizing the challenges ahead. Balancing my studies and racing, I aim to build a strong foundation for my future.
            </br></br>
            Join me on this thrilling journey as I strive for excellence both on and off the track.
            Your support fuels my determination, and I can't wait to share my adventures in karting and beyond.
